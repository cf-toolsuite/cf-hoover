You're already aware of and are using [cf-butler](https://github.com/cf-toolsuite/cf-butler) to help report on and manage application and service instances.  Wouldn't it be nice to easily aggregate reporting across multiple foundations? This is `cf-hoover`'s raison d'Ãªtre.

* [JDK](http://openjdk.java.net/install/) 21 or better
* [cf](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) CLI 8.6.1 or better


## Clone

```
git clone https://github.com/cf-toolsuite/cf-hoover.git
```


## How to configure

Make a copy of then edit the contents of the `application.yml` file located in `src/main/resources`.  A best practice is to append a suffix representing the target deployment environment (e.g., `application-pws.yml`, `application-pcfone.yml`). You will need to provide administrator credentials to Apps Manager for the foundation if you want the butler to keep your entire foundation tidy.

> You really should not bundle configuration with the application. To take some of the sting away, you might consider externalizing and/or [encrypting](https://blog.novatec-gmbh.de/encrypted-properties-spring/) this configuration.

### Managing external configuration

Create a [Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial) repository or work with a [Vault](https://www.baeldung.com/vault) instance as the home your configuration.  Cf-hoover has a dependency on the [Spring Cloud Config](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-config/2.1.0.RELEASE/single/spring-cloud-config.html#_locating_remote_configuration_resources) client, but is disabled by default.

The `cloud` [profile](https://spring.io/understanding/profiles) enables the client, so when you [cf push](https://docs.run.pivotal.io/devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html#push) cf-hoover, [bind](https://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/bind-service.html) it to a [properly configured](https://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/2-0/common/config-server/configuring-with-git.html#general-configuration) Config Server [service instance](https://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/2-0/common/config-server/managing-service-instances.html), and start the app instance, it will consult the [Git](https://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/2-0/common/config-server/configuration-properties.html#git-global-configuration) repo or [Vault](https://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/2-0/common/config-server/configuration-properties.html#vault-global-configuration) instance for configuration to target and aggregate results from one or more previously deployed [cf-butler](https://github.com/cf-toolsuite/cf-butler) instances.

A sample repository exists for your perusal [here](https://github.com/cf-toolsuite/cf-hoover-config).

### Minimum required keys

At a minimum you should supply values for the following keys

* `cf.butlers` -  a map of cf-butler routes

    For example

    properties
    ```
    cf.butlers.pws=cf-butler-grateful-mouse.cfapps.io
    cf.butlers.pcfone=cf-butler-active-tasmaniandevil.apps.pcfone.io
    ```

    yaml
    ```
    cf:
      butlers:
        pws: cf-butler-grateful-mouse.cfapps.io
        pcfone: cf-butler-active-tasmaniandevil.apps.pcfone.io
    ```
    > Each key is an alias for a foundation and each value is the route to an application instance of cf-butler deployed on that foundation

### General configuration notes

If you copied and appended a suffix to the original `application.yml` then you would set `spring.profiles.active` to be that suffix

E.g., if you had a configuration file named `application-pws.yml`

```
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=pws
```

> Consult the [samples](samples) directory for examples.


## How to Build

```
./mvnw clean package
```
### Alternatives

The below represent a collection of Maven profiles available in the Maven POM.

* Log4J2 logging (log4j2)
  * swaps out [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch/documentation.html) logging provider for [Log4J2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/async.html) and [Disruptor](https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/user-guide/index.html#_introduction)
* Native image (native)
  * uses [Spring AOT](https://docs.spring.io/spring-native/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#spring-aot-maven) to compile a native executable with [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/introduction/)


```
./mvnw clean package -Plog4j2
```
> Swap out default "lossy" logging provider


```
# Using Cloud Native Buildpacks image
./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -Pnative

# Using pre-installed Graal CE
./mvnw native:compile -Pnative -DskipTests
```


## How to Run with Maven

```
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active={target_foundation_profile}
```
where `{target_foundation_profile}` is something like `pws` or `pcfone`

> You'll need to manually stop to the application with `Ctrl+C`

Alternatively, if you intend to setup [cf-hoover-ui](https://github.com/cf-toolsuite/cf-hoover-ui), for a local development environment deployment then, you must first:

* Launch a standalone instance of [Eureka server](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/multi/multi_spring-cloud-eureka-server.html)

Set an additional property before launching `cf-hoover`

```
-Dspring.cloud.discovery.enabled=true
```


## How to check code quality with Sonarqube

Launch an instance of Sonarqube on your workstation with Docker

```
docker run -d --name sonarqube -p 9000:9000 -p 9092:9092 sonarqube
```

Then make sure to add goal and required arguments when building with Maven. For example:

```
mvn sonar:sonar -Dsonar.login=admin -Dsonar.password=admin
```

Then visit `http://localhost:9000` in your favorite browser to inspect results of scan.


## How to deploy to VMware Tanzu Application Service

Please review the [manifest.yml](manifest.yml) before deploying.

### Using scripts

Deploy the app (bound to an instance of Spring Cloud Config Server)

Create a file named `config-server.json` located in a `config` sub-directory off the root of this project. Look at the sample [here](samples/config-server.json) to get an idea of the contents.  Consult the Spring Cloud Services Config Server [documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/2-0/common/config-server/index.html) for more advanced configuration options like [SSH repository access](https://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/2-0/common/config-server/configuring-with-git.html#ssh-repository-access).

Then execute

```
./deploy.sh
```

Shutdown and destroy the app and service instances with

```
./destroy.sh
```

> Note: If you are seeing [OutOfMemory exceptions](https://dzone.com/articles/troubleshooting-problems-with-native-off-heap-memo) shortly after startup you may need to [cf scale](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-10/devguide/deploy-apps/cf-scale.html#verticall) the available memory when working with multiple foundations.

Alternative scripts exist for deploying `cf-hoover` when working with `cf-hoover-ui`.  See [deploy.with-registry.sh](deploy.with-registry.sh) and [destroy.with-registry.sh](destroy.with-registry.sh).

## Endpoints

These REST endpoints have been exposed for administrative purposes.

### Snapshot

```
GET /snapshot/organizations
```
> Assembles list of organizations per foundation registered

```
GET /snapshot/spaces
```
> Assembles list of spaces per foundation registered


```
GET /snapshot/spaces/users
```
> Provides details and light metrics for users by role within all organizations and spaces across all registered foundations

Sample output
```
[

    foundation: "pws"
    organization: "Northwest",
    space: "akarode",
    auditors: [ ],
    developers: [
      "wlund@pivotal.io",
      "akarode@pivotal.io"
    ],
    managers: [
      "wlund@pivotal.io",
      "akarode@pivotal.io"
    ],
    users: [
      "wlund@pivotal.io",
      "akarode@pivotal.io"
    ],
    user-count: 2,
  },
  {
    foundation: "pws"
    organization: "Northwest",
    space: "arao",

```
> `users` is the unique subset of all users from each role in the organization/space

```
GET /snapshot/{foundation}/{organization}/{space}/users
```
